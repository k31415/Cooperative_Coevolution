-----Folder Code: 
The evolution can be started through "python3 main.py". This script gets parameters from config-aerial, config-ground and simulator.py. It saves its results in the Results-folder. 

Plots are created through "python3 plot_[type].py". 
- The plot_evaluation script generates a plot of the evolution of the fitness for each input file and a summary plot for each variant (such as fiftc, riftc, ...). 
- The plot_simulation script generates an animated video of the best pair for ont input file.
- The plot_path script generates a plot for each input file where the paths of the best pair of robots is shown. 

The final_evaluation.py script redoes the final evaluation of each best pair per generation. This script is not fully tested so there is no garanty for its correct functionality. 




-----Folder Results: 
Results and plots of the runs stated in the paper "Performance of Cooperative Coevolution in Different Scenarios with Heterogeneous Robot Teams" from Katharina Spitzley. 

- Folder animation: 
Here the animation videos created with plot_animation.py will be saved.

- Folder evolutions: 
Here the plots from plot_evolution.py will be saved.

- Folder trajectories: 
Here the trajectory plots from plot_path.py will be saved.
